Demo of a childtheme using the REST API
=======================================

The child theme was created by the Orbisius plugin. 

* In functions.php the javascript in /js/js.js is loaded.
* The REST API js is found in the folder /js/js.js

The script will try to load content to a div with the id rest:

`<div id="rest"></div>`

If you create a page and add the div in text-mode, the content will load there. Alternatively you can add a custom html widget and add the div there.
